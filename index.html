        <img src="business.png" alt="Business" data-quote="&quot;Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.&quot;" 
        data-second-quote="In &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; the businessman's words represent a critique of materialism and ownership. His focus on possessing everything reflects a shallow mindset that prioritizes wealth over genuine human connection, mirroring broader societal values. By claiming ownership of diamonds, islands, and stars, he illustrates the absurdity of trying to control what is beyond human reach. Through this portrayal, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry highlights the emptiness of a life driven solely by the pursuit of wealth and possessions. He encourages readers to find fulfillment in meaningful relationships and experiences instead.">
       
        <img src="drunkard.png" alt="Drunkard" data-quote="&quot;Why are you drinking?&quot; the little prince asked. &quot;In order to forget,&quot; replied the drunkard. &quot;To forget what?&quot; enquired the little prince, who was already feeling sorry for him. &quot;To forget that I am ashamed,&quot; the drunkard confessed, hanging his head."
        data-second-quote="In &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; the drunkard's use of alcohol to forget represents a universal human tendency to avoid confrontation through escapism. As he acknowledges the burden that he carries, the little prince responds with empathy and compassion, demonstrating the importance of understanding and kindness. Through this interaction, the story delves into the complexities of the human condition, portraying the struggle with inner demons and the potential for redemption and personal growth." >
      
        <img src="earth.png" alt="Earth" data-quote="&quot;What a strange planet!&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;It is quite dry, covered with peaks, salty and inhospitable. And the people have no imagination. They just repeat whatever one says to them... On my planet I had a flower: she was always the first to speak.&quot;"
        data-second-quote="The protagonist of &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; reflects on the peculiarities of his new planet in this passage. The barren, inhospitable landscape symbolizes a lack of creativity and imagination, contrasting with the richness and vibrancy of his own planet. The lack of creative conversation among the inhabitants accentuates the planet's dullness and sameness. Through this observation, the little prince grieves over the absence of the lively companionship he once enjoyed with his flower on his home planet. The contrast between the two planets highlights themes of loneliness, longing for connection, and the power of companionship and creativity.">
       
        <img src="b612.png" alt="b612" data-quote="&quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot;"
        data-second-quote="The author highlights the importance of looking beyond appearances to understand deeper truths. The heart, representing intuition and emotion, contrasts with the eye, which focuses only on the visible. The text suggests that true understanding comes from connecting with others on a deeper level. This quote reminds us to value relationships and spiritual insights above surface-level observations.">

It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study…&quot;"
